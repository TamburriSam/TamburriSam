I'm a frontend engineer with a love for building intuitive and emotionally aware web apps.

Creator of **[Cognitive Mirror]((https://cognitivemirror.net/))** â€“ an AI tool for reframing thought patterns through psychology-inspired modes.

Currently working with Vue 3, Composition API, Tailwind, Firebase, and various LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). I care about intuitive UI, clean architecture, and building things that feel honest.

Interests:
- Thoughtful product design
- Human-centered AI
- Philosophy + mental health tech
